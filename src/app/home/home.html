  <h1>Welcome to Robert C Eskridge's Portfolio!</h1>
  <p>This website was independently written using <strong>Angular</strong> in <strong>Visual Studio Code.</strong></p>
  <p>The purpose of this website is to display my projects, publications, portfolio, and a little bit about my life and my spare time. I do projects like this by hand to keep up with my skills, best practices, and to learn some new ways to improve.</p>
  <p>Use the tabs to navigate around this site. Feel free to contact me with questions, corrections, or just to get to know me!</p>
