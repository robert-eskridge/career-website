    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>PMKS+ was my senior capstone project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I focused on improving the kinematic calculator simulations and the UI/UX.</p>

    <h3>Fundamental Skills</h3>
    <p>
        By utilizing Angular and Typescript, myself and two teammates created an intuitive program for new mechanical engineering students to use in class.
        The most valuable skill I learned was definitely <strong>UI / UX</strong> best practices. I also learned efficient ways to <strong>organize large-scale projects</strong> 
        and improve developer utility. I remember inheriting the previous team's codebase and spending weeks trying to unravel the piles and piles of divs without ids or classes.
        By working directly with out professors, I got a solid foundation for how to meet both <strong>user and customer expectations.</strong>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Students learning to design and analyze planar mechanisms often have the additional struggle of needing to learn sophisticated professional software such as SolidWorks. 
        PMKS+ is a web application that aims to reduce this struggle by including only the functionality needed for novice students. PMKS+ has existed for years but the complexity 
        of its implementation complicated further development. This project aimed to complete a refactor of PMKS+ focused on adhering to software design principles. We selected a new 
        architecture for the program, allowing us to re-implement a majority of the existing features while adding support for multiple mechanisms, along with new mechanism manipulation 
        functionality. Additionally, we analyzed the existing interface to improve system usability in the new implementation while adhering to standard HCI principles. Our comparative 
        evaluation showed an improvement in user experience as well as a drastic improvement in code structure and documentation.

        Icelandic Immigration Integration Publication Link

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        For my study abroad, I went to Iceland and researched the different factors restricting immigrants from participating fully in Icelandic society. We interviewed two dozen 
        people over seven weeks including parliamentarians, professors, blue-collar workers, and immigration officials. We conducted several broad user surveys of immigrants and natives 
        to identify cultural trends and common sentiments across demographics. Our final presentation was cataloguing our findings into groundwork research, presented to our professors and government contacts.

    <h3>Fundamental Skills</h3>
    <p>
        Being a social project at it's heart, this experience taught me a lot about how to respectfully engage with people that you fundamentally disagree with. At the end of the day, my role
        was more of a journalist than someone who was able to SOLVE these problems, and learning to recognize that took time. Building out my own biases and learning to work with my team through 
        the difficult parts of our project was also a valuable skill. We had to pivot our original research topic and engaging with our original research while still finding new ways to engage with the 
        subject matter was very difficult. Overall, I'm proud of the skills I developed and the project managed to deliver working within the constraints of both time and logistics.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        As immigration steadily increases in Iceland, a community of foreign-born individuals continues to grow. Whilst some of these foreigners may already have acquired the skill of English, 
        most have not yet gained the ability to speak Icelandic at a culturally significant level. Iceland, being particular with the language and how it is utilized, manifests many invisible 
        barriers to language acquisition, and hence participation in society. Individuals are hindered by their inability to communicate, affecting their ability to get jobs despite being qualified. 
        Although not a hard requirement to be able to work in Iceland, the Icelandic language may open many more doors to higher paying jobs. Understanding the language at the highest level is also 
        nearly required to participate in Icelandic politics. Some may be able to quickly get a synopsis of a political party's stance through the limited resources available, but direct participation 
        is much more difficult to enter. Large communities of immigrants are also formed based on similar ethnicities and origins. This creates large diasporas of people who assist each other in 
        day-to-day life, while also becoming a type of middleman in terms of translating resources for the larger group. This can provide a useful resource for newly settled individuals, but also 
        decreases the likelihood that one ventures outside of the community. Children, being sponges for language, also begin to speak in English frequently, which poses a hindrance for their 
        ability to learn the Icelandic language. Because of these barriers in the acquisition of the Icelandic language, many have difficulty participating in society in some facets.
