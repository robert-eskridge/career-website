<h1>My Volunteering</h1>
<h2>Worldpackers</h2>
<p>
    I currently spend my days volunteering abroad through Worldpackers. I've helped build sustainable homes, maintain permaculture gardens, 
    and promote centers of cultural immersion. I believe it's the responsibility of every individual to provide for themselves and those who depend on them, 
    and to use at least SOME of their extra resources to help others.

        I spent 10 days in La Souche, France, helping create the walls of a sustainable home. We used a French Canadian construction technique to build a majority 
        of the insulation out of straw, with ecologically friendly concrete poured in for stability. I'd never worked construction, but it was fun to learn!

        After La Souche, I spent 18 days in the middle of nowhere in a region of France called Ariege. I helped a family with their English, their dog,
        winter stockpiles of wood and food, gardening, and more. I picked up a lot of French at this farm, and I really miss it!

<h2>Independent</h2>
<p>
    While working in Albany, I took up a position as a volunteer English tutor at the local refugee center. It was rewarding to see people from around the world 
    become receptive to the way I taught and begin to understand how to integrate into an American lifestyle. I loved working with my regulars, because even though we 
    could hardly communicate, we still found ways to make each other laugh.
