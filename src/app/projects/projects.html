        <h3>Hospital Equipment Tracker</h3>
        <p>
            In my software engineering course at WPI, I joined a team of 8 other students to make an application that could catalogue and track hospital equipment. The front end 
            was developed primarily in Java and JavaFX, and the back end relied on a combination of SQL and AWS. I was primarily a front end developer on this project. We simulated 
            transferring the equipment aorund the building and between floors, it's status, time since last maintenance, and who had interacted with it last. We also implemented 
            an A* pathfinding algorithm to give employees the most effective route from point A to point B, without interfering with areas congested at the time by equipment or 
            "standard" congestion of personnel and patients.

        <h3>Blueberry Yield Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            The final project in my machine learning course was to develop an AI that could predict the yield of blueberry plants based on a variety of factors. We used Python 
            to create a 4-layer neural network that we fed input data to. After refining our hyperparameters and narrowing down our margin of error we had developed a model that 
            could reliably predict the yield of blueberry plants with over 90% accuracy.

        <h3>QR Code Encoder and Decoder</h3>
        <p>
            One of the projects in my computer networks course was to create a program in C++ that could read QR codes and decode them. After feeding the data into the program, 
            it would respond with the correct output of a link or text or whatever data was contained inside the code. I took it a step further and added the ability for the program to also 
            ENCODE data into a QR code, producing an image which the user could download or scan to redistribute where they needed.

        <h3>Cultural Diffusion Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            Using Python, I built an app that can simulate cultural diffusion over several hundred nodes efficiently. After doing some research, I decided to base my approach on a graph of nodes and edges 
            and allow each node to be influenced by it's neighbors. On generation, every node is assigned a random hex color, influence value, and stubborness value. Over time, random events will occur to 
            reduce deterministic outcomes. The simulation plays out over a user-specified number of iterations. I also added several different methods for graph generation to observe what impact different 
            random connected graph layouts would have on diffusion.

        <h3>Visualizing Search Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            As a precursor / warmup for the cultural diffusion simulator I created a visualizer for different graph searching algorithms and began visualizing different pathfinding algorithms as well. 
            Breadth First Search and Depth First Search are both visually displayed at the prompting of the user. There is also the option to see a visualization of Djikstra's algorithm, with user provided 
            start and end nodes. By using a combination of pygame and networkx I was able to achieve some solid visual demonstrations on small graphs.

        <h3>AI Character Chatbot</h3>
        <p>
            I took an existing framework for openAI chatbots made by content creator DougDoug, and optimized it for the specific use case of a discord bot that could interact with my friends online. I utilized 
            openAI's API for chatgpt, microsoft Azure TTS, and ElevenLabs voice API to create a bot that could remember conversations and continue them after time had passed.

        <h3>Snake in Python</h3>
        <p>
            This one's really simple, to practice using Python's pygame library I just rebuilt snake. Not a lot to say here, it's snake. Fun to play though!
