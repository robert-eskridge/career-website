<h1>About Robert Eskridge</h1>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I received a <strong>Computer Science</strong> B.S. degree from <strong>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> in May 2024. 
    I completed this degree in four years, with a focus on algorithm analysis and design.</p>
<p>Over the course of my degree, I definitely narrowed in on a few favorite courses. <strong>Software Security Engineering</strong> was a data security course, from the perspective of the hacker. 
    We recieved different binaries and had to use the techniques we learned in class to break them and get points. 
    <strong>Algorithms Analysis and Design</strong> was a graduate-level course about mathematical proofs and big O analysis of different algorithms, specifically applied to graph theory.
    <strong>Machine Learning</strong> was a fun course to explore the math behind different learning algorithms. It's wild that most of the problems we face can be turned into math problems with a math solution. 
    WPI's quarterly courses meant I learned a lot about computer science in a very short time. Some honorable mentions for my favorites include <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, 
    <strong>Computer Networking</strong>, <strong>OOP</strong>, and <strong>Systems</strong>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I grew up in suburbs across the USA and in South Korea. When I was 10 years old, my family moved to San Antonio, Texas where we stayed until I was 18. 
    After graduating high school I made the decision to pursue a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> from <strong>WPI.</strong> Arriving in Massachusetts was a bit of a culture shock, 
    especially given that this was in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. I made friends and found community through my extra-cirriculars. My favorite was <strong>Guerilla Improv</strong>, 
    the student comedy club which I was a member of for four years and in charge of for one. I was an active member of the <strong>Lambda Chi Alpha (LCA)</strong> fraternity on campus, and chaired the executive judicial committee.
    I ran recruitment for the <strong>senior honor society TSOA</strong>, an organization focused on community development and organizing volunteer opportunities. I also signed up to be a 
    <strong>First Year Orientation Advisor</strong> as another way to give back to the school community. After graduating, I worked for just over a year as a member of upper management at an electronics recycling company 
    in Albany, NY, called <strong>Protek Recycling.</strong> The last few months I've spent <strong>volunteering around the world</strong>, immersing myself in local culture, and getting a truly global experience. 
    Through the course of my life, I've always strived to make contributions to the community around me and the teams I'm a part of, which is why I'm driven to leadership opportunities. 
    I'm seeking to jump into the next chapter in my life, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    I fill my free time by doing what makes me happy! "Planned" hobbies look like volunteering as an English tutor, playing pickup volleyball, and going hiking.
    I plan all of these activities in advance, or they happen on specific days. I like to fill as much of my time as possible with human interaction.
    "Unplanned" looks like playing guitar, baking, gardening, practicing a language, playing games with my family, making hard cider, and going out with my friends. 
    Whenever I have free time, I'm pretty consistently doing one of these things. The feeling of eating or drinking something I made on my own is very satisfying, and I like sharing what I make with my friends and roommates.
    Learning new things is way more fun than people give it credit for, which is why I like to practice my guitar, Spanish, and French.
